              Our History
            </h3>
            <p>
              Lucha Tacos was founded in 2023 by three siblings who were
              inspired by their abuela's cherished recipes. The small
              family-owned taco stand has since blossomed into a beloved
              community hotspot, renowned for its commitment to using the
              freshest locally sourced ingredients and preparing every dish from
              scratch. Our journey from a humble beginning to a flourishing
              establishment is a testament to our unwavering dedication to
              quality and authenticity.
