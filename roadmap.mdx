### Migration notes (developer-facing)
- Numeric price behavior changed: numbers now interpreted as dollars by default.  
  - If you previously passed integer cents (e.g., `{ price: 100 }`) change to `{ priceCents: 100 }` or `{ price: 1.00 }`.  
- Update tests referencing price integers.

---

### Commands & CI notes
- Install: `npm ci`  
- Run tests: `npm test -- --runInBand` or `npx jest --runInBand`  
- Add coverage script: `"coverage": "jest --coverage"` and run `npm run coverage`  
- Recommended CI node-version: `20.x` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

### Next recommended actions
1. Add E2E tests to CI and ensure a stable start-server step.  
2. Add coverage reporting + Codecov badge.  
3. Add Lighthouse CI job on PRs or nightly runs.  
4. Run accessibility and security scans on staging.  
5. Open PR with migration notes requesting reviews.
