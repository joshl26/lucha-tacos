#### Phase 2: Functionality ðŸš€ (PRIORITY â€” IN PROGRESS)

- Cart System
  - [x] Implement working add-to-cart functionality (cart.js + cart-ui.js)

  - [x] Replace blocking alerts with accessible, non-blocking toast notifications
  - [x] Add accessible aria-live announcer and focus-trapped modal
  - [~] Cross-tab sync: NOT enabled (sessionStorage is per-tab). Option to add localStorage toggle remains.

#### Notes & Considerations (current)

- Files changed / implemented in this sprint:
  - cart.js â€” replaced with sessionStorage-persisted cart (exports singleton `cart`) and public createCart() factory.
  - cart-ui.js â€” replaced with toast-based, accessible modal UI listening to `cart:changed`.
  - app.js â€” updated with nav active-state helper and wiring so Add buttons include data attributes required by cart-ui.
  - styles.css â€” appended toast and small UX/collision fixes (bump animation, focus outlines).
- Key technical details:
  - Persistence: sessionStorage used (per-tab). Cart summary is saved under key `lucha_cart_v1`.
  - Eventing: `window` emits a `cart:changed` CustomEvent with the cart summary in detail so other modules can react.
  - Accessibility: aria-live announcer, focus trap in modal, aria-labels on controls.
  - Price handling: prices stored and handled as integer cents in cart.js to avoid floating-point issues.

- Decisions made (so you don't need to re-approve):
  - Option B chosen: sessionStorage persistence (per-tab). This improves UX on reload within same tab and avoids cross-tab sync complexity.
  - Non-blocking toast implemented to replace alert() placeholders.

- Quick risks / TODOs to address asap:
  - Ensure cart-ui.js and cart.js are loaded as ES modules on all pages that have Add buttons (index.html, order/index.html). Relative pathing matters â€” verify script tags.
  - QA link paths (menu JSON fetch paths are relative; confirm hosting structure).
  - Cross-tab behavior expected: carts do not sync between tabs when using sessionStorage. If cross-tab sync is required, switch to localStorage with optional conflict handling.

---

#### Recommended next steps (highest priority)

1. Cross-tab persistence decision:
   - Option A: Keep sessionStorage (current) â€” per-tab persistence, simpler.
   - Option B: Enable localStorage toggle (recommended if users may open multiple tabs and expect shared cart). I can implement a toggle constant in cart.js that defaults to sessionStorage but can be set to localStorage.

2. Script injection & patch:
   - I can produce a single .diff patch that replaces files (cart.js, cart-ui.js, app.js, styles.css) and updates index.html / order/index.html to include correct `<script type="module">` tags with correct relative paths. This is the fastest way to apply changes.

3. QA pass:
   - Run the verification checklist across desktop and mobile:
     - Add items â†’ toast appears, badge updates
     - Open cart modal â†’ items, qty controls, remove, clear, subtotal work
     - Refresh page â†’ cart persists (sessionStorage)
     - Cross-tab behavior â†’ expected no sync
     - Accessibility checks with a screen reader: aria-live announcements & keyboard focus trap
   - Report any layout overlaps (footer, hero text) to triage into Phase 2 layout fixes.

4. Polish UX:
   - Replace remaining alert() placeholders with accessible modals or toasts (checkout flow scaffold).
   - Add feedback form modal and wire delivery partner links.
