  - [x] Debug JavaScript rendering logic
  - [x] Test menu-items.json data loading
  - [x] Verify menu-categories.json loads correctly

  - [x] Remove all localStorage usage from app.js
  - [x] Convert to in-memory state (variables/objects)
  - [x] Test state persistence during session
  - [x] Document new state management approach

- Homepage Content

  - [x] Diversify wrestling/masked wrestler metaphors
  - [x] Keep unique branding, reduce redundancy
  - [x] Review overall messaging clarity

#### Phase 2: Functionality ðŸš€ (PRIORITY â€” IN PROGRESS)

- Cart System
  - [x] Implement working add-to-cart functionality (cart.js + cart-ui.js)
  - [x] Create cart display/modal (cart modal implemented in cart-ui.js)
  - [x] Add quantity adjustment controls (plus/minus in menu + modal qty controls)
  - [x] Implement remove from cart option (remove control in modal)
  - [x] Display running cart total (subtotal shown in modal and badge updated)

#### Notes & Considerations (current)

- What was implemented in this sprint:
  - Added a module-based cart implementation: `cart.js` (in-memory cart API).
  - Built `cart-ui.js` to provide:
    - Cart button + badge
    - Accessible cart modal (dialog) with focus trap
    - Item rendering in modal, qty controls, remove, clear, subtotal
    - Auto-wiring of `.add-to-cart` buttons (reads data-id, data-name, data-price-cents, optional data-qty)
  - Updated `app.js` to:
    - Render menu categories and items
    - Ensure `Add` buttons include data attributes: data-id, data-name, data-price-cents
    - Update per-item qty controls and set data-qty before Add
  - Minimal CSS added for modal/button (recommend merging into styles.css)

- Key constraint to decide:
  - Persistence: current cart is in-memory and persists only for the current page lifetime. If you want cart to survive page reloads, add sessionStorage/localStorage restore/serialize in cart.js â€” I can do that if you want.

- Quick risks / TODOs to address asap:
  - Make sure cart-ui.js is included as a module on all pages using add-to-cart (index.html, order/index.html).
  - QA cross-directory paths for JSON and script includes (menu JSON path logic is already in app.js but verify hosting structure).
  - Finalize navigation active-state logic so users know when theyâ€™re on the menu vs order pages.

#### Recommended next steps (highest priority)

1. Decide persistence behavior:
   - Option A: keep in-memory only (no reload persistence) â€” faster, simpler.
   - Option B: add sessionStorage persistence in cart.js (recommended for better UX).
   Tell me which and Iâ€™ll implement immediately.

2. Finish Navigation & QA:
   - Fix nav active states site-wide and run link check across pages.

3. UX polish for Phase 2:
   - Replace alert() notifications with a non-blocking toast.
   - Add hover/focus states and small animations for add-to-cart feedback.

4. Run an end-to-end manual test checklist across desktop & mobile and capture issues to triage into Phase 2/3.
