#### Notes & Considerations

- Current Strengths:
  - Unique lucha libre branding
  - Quality food photography
  - Autoplay video hero
  - Bootstrap foundation
  - Multi-location setup

- Key Constraints:
  - No localStorage available on some platforms â€” in-memory session state is required
  - Menu/order flow is the primary revenue path â€” prioritize Phase 2 cart system and navigation
  - Accessibility & SEO fixes are complete (Phase 1); keep accessibility practices for future changes

#### Recommended next step
- Prioritize Phase 2 â€” implement the cart modal/display and quantity controls so the existing add-to-cart behavior has a clear UX flow.
