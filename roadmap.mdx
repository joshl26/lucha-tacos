#### Notes & Considerations (current)

- Files changed in recent sprints:
  - **styles.css** — Fixed footer overlap (flexbox layout), responsive hero text sizing, adjusted mobile positioning
  - **app.js** — Extensive console logging added for debugging menu filtering, cart integration fixes
  - **cart-ui.js** — Fixed data attribute reading for add-to-cart buttons
  - **order/index.html** — Removed duplicate cart button initialization code

- Key technical details:
  - **Layout:** Main element uses flexbox with min-height: 100vh, footer uses margin-top: auto
  - **Responsive Text:** Hero text scales: 6rem (desktop) → 3.5rem (tablet) → 2.5rem (mobile) → 2rem (small mobile)
  - **Cart Integration:** Items use `data-item-id`, `data-item-name`, `data-item-price`, `data-item-quantity`
  - **Price Format:** Prices stored as cents (integer) in cart.js, displayed with $ formatting
  - **Navigation:** All pages use consistent "Home", "Order Menu", "About" labels with data-page attributes
  - **Persistence:** sessionStorage used (per-tab). Cart summary saved under key `lucha_cart_v1`

- Known issues to address:
  - ⚠️ **Menu category filtering not working** (All Items shows everything, but clicking Tacos/Burritos/Quesadillas doesn't filter)
    - Categories load correctly
    - Items have categoryKey property
    - Click handlers may not be firing properly
    - Need to verify event listener attachment
  - Spacing and padding consistency needs review across pages
  - Mobile/tablet responsive design needs comprehensive testing

- Decisions made (so you don't need to re-approve):
  - Footer uses flexbox auto-margin approach instead of fixed positioning
  - Hero text has 4 breakpoints for optimal readability across devices
  - Duplicate cart button removed from order page (cart-ui.js handles creation)
  - Console logging added throughout app.js for easier debugging
