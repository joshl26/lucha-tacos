### Phase 4: Testing & Launch 🎉

#### Recent Phase 4 status (summary)
- Unit tests: 12 / 12 passing (core + extra edge tests).  
- CI: GitHub Actions workflow added and passing (unit tests run on push/PR).  
- Coverage: implemented (jest --coverage + Codecov upload).  
- E2E: Playwright configured (json/junit/html reporters); artifact sharing fixed.  
- Lighthouse CI: working + badge generation & publishing.  
- Key code change: cart.js API hardened and clarified (numeric prices treated as dollars by default; priceCents supported; storage injection; optional debounce).  
- Next priorities: full E2E flows, accessibility automation (axe), security scans.

### Lighthouse CI & Badges — implementation notes
- CI job:
  - Job name: `lighthouse` — runs LHCI autorun and produces Lighthouse reports.  
  - LHCI uploads median LHRs to Google-hosted report URLs for quick review and writes local `.lighthouseci` output on failures.  
- Badge flow:
  - e2e job writes Playwright JSON to `test-results/results.json` and uploads artifact `playwright-results`.  
  - `lighthouse` job downloads `playwright-results`, runs `scripts/lhci-to-badges.cjs` and `scripts/playwright-to-badge.cjs`.  
  - Scripts write badge JSON files into `public_badges/` (Shields-compatible endpoint format).  
  - `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` publishes `public_badges/` to the repository `gh-pages` branch.  
  - Recommended `.gitignore` entry: `/public_badges/` (published, not committed).

### Playwright config & CI adjustments made
- Added JSON reporter to Playwright config:
  - `["json", { outputFile: "test-results/results.json" }]`  
- E2E job runs `http-server` in background, runs `npx playwright test`, preserves exit code, uploads `test-results/` and `playwright-report/`.  
- Lighthouse job downloads artifact `playwright-results` and uses it to generate Playwright badge JSON (ensures badges reflect the actual e2e run).  
- Debug steps temporarily added to CI to confirm `test-results/results.json` exists while stabilizing.

### Commands & CI notes
- Install: `npm ci`  
- Run tests: `npm test -- --runInBand` or `npx jest --runInBand`  
- Coverage: `npm run coverage` (jest --coverage)  
- Recommended CI node-version: `20.x` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### Next recommended actions
1. Enable automated accessibility checks (axe) inside the E2E flows and generate a11y badges.  
2. Add a nightly LHCI run (or run-on-merge) to track performance regressions.  
3. Add OWASP ZAP nightly scan or other SAST tools.  
4. Open the PR that contains cart.js changes + tests + CI updates + migration notes.  
5. Remove CI debug steps once artifact pipeline is stable.  
6. Add README badges (use the Shields endpoints below) after first successful publish to `gh-pages`.

### README badge examples (replace OWNER and REPO)
```markdown
[![Lighthouse - accessibility](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://OWNER.github.io/REPO/lighthouse-accessibility.json)](https://OWNER.github.io/REPO/lighthouse-accessibility.json)

If you want, I can:
- produce a PR-ready diff that updates `playwright.config.cjs`, the CI workflow, adds `/public_badges/` to `.gitignore`, and inserts the badge markdown into your README; or  
- validate and/or improve the badge generator scripts (`scripts/lhci-to-badges.cjs`, `scripts/playwright-to-badge.cjs`) so they include thresholds, colors, and fallback values.

Which would you like next?
